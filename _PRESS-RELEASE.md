There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  FileTree

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  When you want your cloud storage systems files now, not later.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Many storage services keep your files and let you download them whenever you like. However, sometimes that downloading step isn't what you want. There are places like Imgur, pastebin, and facebook, but sometimes you want a lightweight viewer for your stuff to show off.  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Facebook can be clunky, and privacy issues. Other places either don't let you be flexible with files, or can't load them in browser.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  FileTree will take in common files and load them cleanly in browser. The interface will focus on minimalism and quick results.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "I made this because I wanted to use it."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Register an account quick and easy, and start uploading to your personal folder. Customize your galleries and toggle privacy options freely. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "This is great, and I'm not just saying that because I get free premium features for being quoted"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Coming soon, sit tight and get ready to drop everything else.
